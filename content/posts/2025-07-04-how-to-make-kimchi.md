# How to Make Kimchi

## Introduction

Kimchi, a staple in Korean cuisine, is not only delicious but also packed with probiotics and nutrients. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of making traditional kimchi at home.

## Ingredients

- 1 napa cabbage
- 1 cup of Korean radish, julienned
- 1/2 cup of Korean salted shrimp
- 1/3 cup of fish sauce
- 1/2 cup of Korean red chili pepper flakes
- 1/4 cup of sugar
- 1/4 cup of minced garlic
- 1/4 cup of minced ginger
- Green onions, chopped
- Carrots, julienned

## Steps

1. **Prepare the Cabbage**: Cut the napa cabbage in half lengthwise, then chop it into bite-sized pieces. Sprinkle salt between the leaves and let it sit for a few hours.

2. **Rinse and Drain**: Rinse the cabbage thoroughly to remove excess salt. Squeeze out any excess water and set it aside.

3. **Make the Kimchi Paste**: In a bowl, combine the Korean salted shrimp, fish sauce, red chili pepper flakes, sugar, garlic, and ginger. Mix well to create a paste.

4. **Mix Ingredients**: Add the radish, green onions, and carrots to the paste, and mix until well combined.

5. **Coat the Cabbage**: Coat each piece of cabbage with the kimchi paste, ensuring it is evenly distributed.

6. **Fermentation**: Place the kimchi in a clean, airtight container, pressing down to remove air bubbles. Let it ferment at room temperature for a day or two, then refrigerate.

7. **Enjoy**: Your homemade kimchi is now ready to be enjoyed! Serve it as a side dish, in stews, or fried rice for a burst of flavor.
