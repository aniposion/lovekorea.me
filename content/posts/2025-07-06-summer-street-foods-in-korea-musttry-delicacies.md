Nothing beats the heat quite like Korea's traditional summer beverages. *Sikhye*, a sweet Korean rice drink, is a refreshing fave. It's like a cold hug for your insides, doing wonders on those sizzling, sweaty days. Yet, if you're more into beans (and who isn't?), then *soya bean soup*, or *kongguksu*, is where the magic happens. This chilled, nutty delight is pure soul food. Seriously, give it a slurp!

Can we even talk about summer without mentioning *bingsu*? This shaved ice dessert piled high with red beans, fruits, or even green tea is a godsend on sweltering afternoons. My personal pick? The classic *patbingsu*—it's ridiculously good.

Korea knows how to bring the heat, and I'm not just talking sunbeams. For those who appreciate a kick, *tteokbokki*—spicy, chewy rice cakes—is your best mate. Don’t shy away from its fiery red appearance; it’s every bit as delicious as it is daunting.

Of course, summer isn't complete without the iconic Korean BBQ sizzling away. While traditionally more of a sit-down meal, many street vendors offer *samgyeopsal* (grilled pork belly) skewers for a quick, succulent bite.

Sweet-tooth alert! Korea’s streets become a paradise of fruity, icy delights come summer. The delightful *hwachae*, a traditional Korean fruit punch made with fresh fruits and soda, is like a party in your mouth.

And let’s not overlook those gorgeous, colorful fruit stands dotting the streets. With juicy melons and strawberries galore, it's impossible to pass one without grabbing a quick and healthy treat.

For those wanting something a bit hearty, *bibimbap* mixes rice, veggies, and a touch of meat—all while being an explosion of color and taste!
