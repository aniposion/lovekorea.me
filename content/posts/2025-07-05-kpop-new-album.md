When it comes to K-pop albums, there's always something thrilling about a new release, right? Today, we're diving into V's first solo album, 'Layover'. I'm telling you, this one's a gem! But first, a little story...

Last weekend, I tried making homemade kimchi for the first time, and let's just say, it did not go as planned. It was like... way too salty! ðŸ˜‚ Thankfully, listening to 'Layover' while cautiously tasting my overly seasoned creation, made the experience just a bit sweeter.

V of BTS, known for his deep, soulful voice, has given us something really fresh with 'Layover'. The album is a beautiful showcase of his unique musical sensibilitiesâ€”it's sensitive, it's profound, and well, you just kinda feel it. You know what I mean? Itâ€™s no surprise that every track from the album surpassed 120 million streamsâ€”V is the first K-pop solo artist to achieve this feat!
