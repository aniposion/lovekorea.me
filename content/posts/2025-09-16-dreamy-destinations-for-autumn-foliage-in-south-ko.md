# Dreamy Destinations for Autumn Foliage in South Korea: My 2025 Picks

Can I just say that autumn in South Korea is pure magic? Every year, as the temperatures start to dip a little, the whole country transforms into a vibrant tapestry of reds, oranges, and golds. Last fall, I casually promised myself that I’d explore all the renowned spots the next season, and guess what? 2025 is the year I finally do it. So, where would you start if you had a whole country of postcard-perfect landscapes to choose from?

## Seoraksan National Park: Peaks of Paradise

Seoraksan is the place to be if you're into towering peaks and sweeping vistas. Located in Gangwon Province, it's a must-see regardless of the season, but autumn? Oh, it’s next-level beautiful. I’m particularly excited about the cable car ride that offers panoramic views of the colorful mountainside. I've heard it’s like floating through a sea of molten gold and fiery red leaves. Can you imagine? I wonder if it’ll look anything like the pictures. It might end up being my phone’s new wallpaper!

## Naejangsan National Park: The Maple Leaf Wonderland

Dubbed the "paradise of autumn foliage," Naejangsan in Jeollabuk-do Province is a place I absolutely need to see. The vibrant maple leaves are supposed to be unlike anything else. Do you know those Instagram photos that make you do a double-take? I’m pretty sure they were taken here. I’ve read the hiking trails cater to everyone, from leisurely walkers to hardcore hikers. Which one would you consider yourself?

## Enchanting Evenings on Nami Island

Nami Island is a staple, especially for K-Drama fans. This tiny island turns into something right out of a romantic film each fall. The Metasequoia Lane, in particular, becomes a path of golden hues, perfect for leisurely strolls or even... a proposal, maybe? Anyone thinking of popping the question? I visited during summer once, but I can't wait to see how the autumn tones transform the place.

## Hongcheon Ginkgo Forest's Golden Glory

Now, this one is for the golden hour lovers. The Hongcheon Ginkgo Forest is home to about 2,000 ginkgo trees that turn into a shimmering sea of yellow. For someone like me who finds peace in quiet and nature, this sounds like the ideal spot. It's supposed to be serene, almost like stepping into another world. If only every forest could be this glowing during fall!

## Gyeongju Bulguksa Temple: History Bathed in Color

I'm all for combining cultural exploration with natural beauty, which is why Gyeongju's Bulguksa Temple is on my list. This UNESCO World Heritage site surrounded by vibrant maples sounds like an autumn dream. There's something humbling about seeing ancient architecture alongside nature’s brilliance. Plus, it feels like a scene from a movie—can you see why it's such a draw?

### Quick Tips for Future Travelers
- **Visit Timing:** Mid-October to early November is prime time for foliage viewing.

- **Plan Ahead:** Popular places fill up fast, so book accommodations early.

I can't wait to dive into all these picturesque spots. What would you add to the itinerary? If you’ve been before, let me know—I'd love to hear your experiences and tips!
