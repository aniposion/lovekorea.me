The drama was called *Summer Scent*, and from the very first episode, I was hooked. You know that feeling when a drama speaks to your soul? Yeah, that. I laughed, I cried, I was utterly captivated.

Fast forward to now, and Korean summer melodramas have only grown in diversity and depth. They’ve evolved, yet they hold onto that hauntingly beautiful emotional core that leaves us reaching for tissues.

Now, let’s talk about the 2000s, a golden era for K-dramas. *Summer Scent* (yep, that’s the one that got me hooked) was part of the Four Seasons series, known for its picturesque settings and heart-wrenching stories. These dramas often touched on themes of fate and unrequited love. You know, those classic tropes that keep us coming back for more.
