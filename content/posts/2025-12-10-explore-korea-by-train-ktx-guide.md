The KTX was developed with state-of-the-art technology, reaching speeds of over 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour). This achievement places Korea's high-speed rail network among the fastest in the world. The engineering behind such efficiency includes a dedicated high-speed railway network separate from traditional rail lines, reducing congestion and allowing for more precise scheduling. The aerodynamic design of the train ensures it cuts through the air with minimal resistance.

### Expanding Connections

The expansion of the KTX network continues, with newer lines connecting even more distant parts of the country. Recent developments include the KTX-Suseo line, which offers an alternative route to the southeastern cities, and the Jeju Underground project in the works, planned to connect the mainland to Jeju Island—a journey currently only possible by flight or ferry. Isn't it fascinating how the KTX transforms the concept of distance?
