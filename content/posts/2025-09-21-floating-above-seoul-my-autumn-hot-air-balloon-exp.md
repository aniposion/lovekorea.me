# Floating Above Seoul: My Autumn Hot Air Balloon Experience

Let's be real: when you think of Seoul, hot air balloons probably aren't the first thing that pop into your head. For me, it's usually K-pop, bustling streets, and a skyline that's always reaching higher. So, when I heard about the hot air balloon rides over Seoul in autumn, I was a bit skeptical but super intrigued.

## Booking the Ride of a Lifetime

First things first, the booking process was straightforward. There‚Äôs something about selecting your date and time online that feels like planning a secret adventure, isn‚Äôt there? I remember thinking, ‚ÄúHow often do you get to see Seoul‚Äôs skyline while floating in the sky?‚Äù The only wildcard was the weather, so I had to keep an eye on the forecast leading up to the day.

## Safety First, then Soaring

On the day of the flight, we all gathered at Yeouido Park‚Äîa place usually known for cherry blossoms‚Äîand got suited up with safety gear. Now, I‚Äôm not a fan of long safety briefings, but this one was surprisingly engaging, maybe because I knew what was waiting once it was over. I felt like I was preparing for a little voyage in the sky, and that just added to the excitement.

## Up, Up, and Away!

As the balloon lifted off, a part of me panicked for a split second. It's that moment when you realize there‚Äôs no going back. But honestly, once you're in the sky, any fear gets replaced by awe. Have you ever seen the Han River stretch out, winding and shimmering under the sunlight, from high above? It‚Äôs magical.

The city below started to look like a living map, with tiny figures of people and cars bustling about their day. And the autumn colors? In a word: stunning. Vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow leaves gave Seoul a new outfit that I wasn‚Äôt expecting to fall for. I had to pinch myself to remember that all this was happening in the city I call home.

## A Reminder of Seoul's Surprises

The flight lasted about an hour, but it felt both timeless and fleeting, like a dream you try to hold on to. As we descended back to reality, I felt a mix of gratitude and exhilaration. Sure, it‚Äôs a touristy thing to do, but sometimes being a tourist in your own city offers the best surprises.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Whether you‚Äôre a local looking for a fresh perspective or a visitor wanting to see Seoul as you‚Äôve never seen it before, I say go for it. Just be ready for your heart to skip a beat when you first lift off.

Have you ever taken to the skies in a hot air balloon? Would you dare to try it here in Seoul? I‚Äôd love to hear about your adventures or maybe even your fears‚Äîafter all, one person's terror is another's thrill-ride. üòä
