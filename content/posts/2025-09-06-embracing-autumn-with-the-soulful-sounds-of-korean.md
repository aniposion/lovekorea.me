As the leaves start to turn and that crisp autumn air sneaks in, I find myself diving into my favorite seasonal tradition: hunting down some new tunes to match my mood.

Have you ever had a song make you reflect on where you are and what you have right now? That's exactly what 전찬빈 does with "Dry Rain," an acoustic pop track that dropped on September 2, 2025. It's like hearing the gentle hum of a late afternoon shower as you watch the world go by. I didn't think I'd be so moved by the intricate guitar melodies and his poignant words about love's fleeting moments, but here I am, contemplating life!

Honestly, Melon's 'TrackZero' is my secret weapon for discovering hidden gems. It's hard to believe this platform is already three years old! They’ve brought so many incredible voices into the limelight, with over 1,700 songs and 1,000 artists since its launch. It's my go-to for those days when mainstream just doesn’t cut it, and I need something with depth. Do you have a favorite discovery platform?

One track that continues to haunt me in the best way possible is 면지's "부서진 조각." Even though it came out in July 2022, its soothing acoustic vibe and hopeful lyrics never fail to uplift me. It's the kind of song you put on when you're feeling both wistful and hopeful—a beautiful contradiction.

And then there's 곽태풍's "stroll."—a song reminiscent of that emotional haze right after a breakup. I'm not usually one to get caught up in love ballads, but there's something about the serene melodies and those heartaching lyrics that tug at my heartstrings. Have you ever found a track that perfectly captures a certain season of your life?
