# Seoul Travel Guide: A Day in the City from a Local's View

Hey there! So, last week I had a blast showing my Belgian friend Colin around Seoul. We'd met during my college days, and when he told me he was visiting, I just knew I had to give him a day to remember in this bustling city.

## Meeting at Jonggak: Where the Journey Begins

Our day kicked off at Jonggak Station. I remember standing by the bustling crowd waiting for Colin. Honestly... I was a bit nervous. Would he love Seoul as much as I do? But then, we met up and headed straight to **Bosingak**. Just hearing the bell's story was, honestly, a moment that kind of makes you appreciate how tradition and modernity coexist here.

## Wandering Through Insadong and Bukchon

From Bosingak, we wandered over to **Insadong**, a place that's basically a paradise for anyone looking to dive into Korean culture. Walking through its alleyways, with art and craft shops on either side, you get that feeling... you know, like you're stepping back in time, but also seeing Seoul's modern day personality.

And Bukchon, oh myâ€¦ that's a feast for the eyes. Those hanoks (traditional Korean houses) have such a charm about them that I might have to move there someday! ðŸ˜‚ It's like every corner has a story to tell.

## A Taste of Korea: Naengmyeon and Mandu

Walking made us quite hungry. So, I treated Colin to **Naengmyeon** and some **Mandu**. Now, naengmyeon, if you haven't tried it yet, is a cold noodle dish that's perfect, especially when you're overheating from all the walking. Colin was a bit unsure at first (I mean, cold noodles?!), but he admitted it was surprisingly refreshing.

While munching, we got talking about the global spread of Korean cuisine. Colin joked about starting a Korean food truck back home. Who knows? Maybe it's time Korea takes over Belgium one mandu at a time!

## Evening BBQ and Somaek with Emily

As the day was wrapping up, we joined my friend Emily for some good ol' **pork BBQ** followed by *somaek* (soju and beer combo). Now, if anyone wants to experience Seoul like a local, this is the way to do it. The sizzling pork and the laughter over drinks â€“ it's moments like these that make life here so vibrant.

## Mastering Seoul's Public Transport

Ah, and a side note for anyone planning a visit: navigating Seoul's maze of transportation could seem daunting at first, but trust me, it's super convenient once you get the hang of it. We used the *Kakao Bus* and *Taxi app* to hop from one place to another effortlessly. It's as simple as plugging in your destination, and off you go.

The buses and subways are integrated with automated info systems. Honestly, it's like the city does half the thinking for you. So don't worry, you won't find yourself stranded in the middle of nowhere, promise!

## Ending Thoughts

In the end, even though Colin and I come from different corners of the world, navigating Seoul together brought this refreshing perspective. You start seeing the familiar through someone else's eyes, and it's like falling in love with the city all over again. Seoul, with its endless blend of the old and the new, never disappoints.

If you ever find yourself here, just immerse yourself and maybe take a friend's advice: the best way to see Seoul is to get pleasantly lost. ðŸ˜Š
