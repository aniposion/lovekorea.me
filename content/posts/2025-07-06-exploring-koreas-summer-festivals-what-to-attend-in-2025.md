Imagine this: stunning mountain backdrop, energy-fueled performances, and you soaking it all in. That’s Jisan Valley Rock Festival for you. Set against Korea's serene mountain landscape, this festival promises a mix of international rock bands and local indie talent.

One standout artist this year is Yaeji, the 24-year-old DJ, rapper, and singer who’s been making waves in music circuits. Her unique style is a blend of house, electronic, and a touch of hip-hop that totally rocks. She shared how music helped her overcome loneliness in NYC, forming communities and friends along the way. Her set here? Not to be missed!

Though it’s a total sensory overload, it's also a fantastic way to connect with folks from around the globe. It's about the community, bonding over shared experiences and, well, a lot of mud.

Who would miss a chance to hit the beach while attending a rock festival? This festival is one of Korea’s oldest rock events, showcasing a diverse lineup from headlining international acts to beloved local bands.

Speaking of diversity, Canadian artist Sophia Stel is all about genuine emotional connections in her music. She’s been vocal about the challenges in the music industry but never fails to find beauty in authenticity. That genuine energy and truth come through in her performances.
