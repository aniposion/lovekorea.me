# Discovering Seoul in Hanbok: My Day of Traditions and Photos

When I first heard about renting a hanbok to explore Seoul, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Would I feel awkward wandering around in traditional attire? Would it be comfortable? But I'll tell you this – I’m so glad I gave it a try! It was like I stepped into another world, a beautiful blend of past and present.

## Choosing the Perfect Hanbok

I started my day at the **Hanboknam Bukchon Branch**, conveniently located near Anguk Station Exit 2. The moment I walked in, I was greeted by a sea of colors and patterns hanging on the racks. From intricate embroidery to simple yet elegant designs, the choices were endless. I opted for a more traditional style and, to my delight, they included some lovely hair accessories.

Just a friendly tip: if you're planning to visit during spring or autumn, remember to book in advance because this place can get quite busy!

## Exploring Bukchon Hanok Village

Dressed in my hanbok, I headed to the **Bukchon Hanok Village**. The first thing I noticed was how seamlessly the hanbok fit into the setting. Walking through the narrow streets adorned with traditional hanoks, I felt like I was part of a living history.

Of all the spots, the *Bukchon Eight Views* were my favorites. Each location offers a unique perspective, from the charming alleyways of Gahoe-dong to the serene views from Bukchon Observatory. Have you ever felt so immersed in a place that you lost track of time? That's exactly what happened to me there.

## Gyeongbokgung Palace: A Majestic Backdrop

No trip in a hanbok is complete without visiting **Gyeongbokgung Palace**. Fun fact: you actually get free admission if you're wearing a hanbok! As I wandered through the grand courtyards and marveled at the architecture, I couldn’t resist snapping photo after photo. The Palace at sunset is a sight to behold – if you go, make sure you’re there when the changing of the guard ceremony happens.

## Unwinding at Seoul Forest Park

After a day of strolling through history, I craved a change of scenery. So, I made my way to **Seoul Forest Park**. The refreshing greenness and open spaces were a perfect end to my adventurous day. Walking down the Metasequoia Road, especially in the autumn light, felt like stepping into a painting.

If you’re planning a hanbok adventure in Seoul, bring your ID, as most rental places require it. Also, check if they have storage services for all those bags and petticoats! I found renting a hanbok both easy and fun – and it made my photos all the more memorable.

I must admit, I initially didn’t think I’d love dressing up in a hanbok this much. But there was something magical about merging traditional clothing with the iconic landmarks of Seoul. Have you ever tried wearing a hanbok? If so, how was your experience? If not, what would tempt you to give it a try?

Looking back, the memories I created weren’t just about the places but also about stepping into a piece of Korea’s vibrant culture. It's something I wouldn't trade for the world.
