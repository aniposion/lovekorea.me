# Discovering Seoul's Han River Pools: A Splish-Splash Review for 2025

Hey there, fellow summer enthusiasts! ‚òÄÔ∏è 

If you're anything like me, the thought of finding a refreshing escape from the sweltering heat of a Korean summer sends little waves of joy through your brain. And what better way to do that than to dip into one of Seoul's beloved Han River outdoor swimming pools? I recently decided I'd compare a few, and, oh boy, do I have some thoughts (and a bit of chlorine) to share!

## Ttukseom Joy: Lazy Rivers and Night Dips

First up is the Ttukseom Swimming Pool, nestled in the Gwangjin-gu district. This place feels like a mini water park with its lazy river ‚Äî yes, a river to lazily float around! I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Have you ever just draped yourself on an inflatable and let the world drift by? Trust me, it‚Äôs almost meditative. 

The big plus? They have night sessions until 10:00 PM. Who knew swimming under the starlit sky could be this serene? And let‚Äôs talk about the price... just 5,000 KRW for adults. That's cheaper than my usual coffee order!

## Yeouido: Classic Breeze and Mass Appeal

Next, I paddled over to Yeouido Hangang Park. This one‚Äôs like the big hangout spot where everyone seems to go. It's a little busier, hosting up to 3,600 people, so if you enjoy a bustling vibe, this might be your jam. Luckily, it‚Äôs easy on the pocket with the same entrance fees as all the others. Each stroke in the pool felt almost like a dance with a community of fellow swimmers. Can you picture it?

## Jamsil's Infinity Pool Bliss

Oh, and the infamous infinity pool at Jamsil! Imagine swimming with views of the majestic Han River and the iconic Lotte World Tower ‚Äî it‚Äôs as Instagram-worthy as it sounds. And honestly, it was a bit surreal. I spent a fair amount of time here just floating and people-watching. Ever noticed how that‚Äôs oddly relaxing?

## Jamwon‚Äôs Beachy Escape

Finally, let‚Äôs chat about Jamwon's pool. Ever wanted a beach vibe without actually heading to the coast? Picture sand and palm trees right by the river. I did not expect to feel like I was on a tropical retreat in the middle of Seoul, but there it was. A little corner of Seoul turned sandy getaway ‚Äî who would‚Äôve thought?

## More Reasons to Dive In

Each pool packs fascinating experiences with comfy facilities, including changing rooms, showers, and rest areas. Plus, wearing swim caps is a thing here ‚Äî a heads-up (literally) if you're new. Whether you're a local or just visiting Seoul, these pools, running from June 20 to August 31, 2025, are surely a splish-splashing good time.

But what about you? Do any of these pools make you want to leap into your swimwear? I‚Äôd love to hear if you‚Äôve visited them or if they‚Äôre now on your summer bucket list! üåä
