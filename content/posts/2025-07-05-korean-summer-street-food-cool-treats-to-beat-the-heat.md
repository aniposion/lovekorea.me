If there's one treat that screams Korean summer, it's got to be **Bingsu**! This isn't your average shaved ice. I'm talking about finely shaved milk ice, topped with sweet condensed milk, and a variety of toppings like red beans, fruits, and sometimes even a scoop of ice cream. I remember the first time I tried bingsu—it was like a snowstorm in July, except way more delicious. Whether you opt for the classic **Patbingsu** (with sweetened red beans) or dive into modern variations with mango or green tea flavors, bingsu is the ultimate Korean summer cooler.

## Samanco: Ice Cream Fish? Yes, Please!

You read that right! **Samanco** is an adorable fish-shaped ice cream treat that never fails to deliver that sweet serenity in the summer heat. Filled with smooth red bean paste and vanilla ice cream, all encased in a crispy wafer, each bite is an explosion of flavors and textures. How can ice cream that looks like a fish not be worth trying? It’s quirky, fun, and super popular among kids and adults alike.
